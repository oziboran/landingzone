# landingzone
Creating a comprehensive AWS Landing Zone involves several components and configurations to ensure security, compliance, scalability, and consistency across your AWS environment. In this example, I'll guide you through creating an AWS Landing Zone using Terraform, including the setup of two new AWS accounts for development and production. Additionally, we'll centrally configure AWS Config Rules and CloudTrail using Terraform.

AWS Landing Zone Overview and Purpose
An AWS Landing Zone provides a standardized and automated approach to set up and manage multiple AWS accounts for different purposes (e.g., development, production) in a secure and compliant manner. The Landing Zone helps in achieving the following goals:

Security: Implement security controls and best practices consistently across accounts.
Compliance: Ensure compliance with organizational policies and industry standards.
Cost Management: Implement cost controls and budgeting mechanisms.
Scalability: Design for scalability and high availability.
Resource Management: Centrally manage and monitor resources.
Terraform Code for AWS Landing Zone
Here's an example Terraform code to create an AWS Landing Zone, along with two new AWS accounts for development and production. We'll also configure AWS Config Rules and CloudTrail centrally.

Install and Configure Terraform: Make sure you have Terraform installed and configured with appropriate AWS credentials.

Create main.tf file:

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_organizations_organization" "my_organization" {
  feature_set = "ALL"
}

# Create DevAccount
resource "aws_organizations_account" "dev_account" {
  name             = "DevAccount"
  email            = "dev@example.com"
  parent_id        = aws_organizations_organization.my_organization.roots[0].id
  role_name        = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  iam_user_access_to_billing = "ALLOW"
}

# Create ProdAccount
resource "aws_organizations_account" "prod_account" {
  name             = "ProdAccount"
  email            = "prod@example.com"
  parent_id        = aws_organizations_organization.my_organization.roots[0].id
  role_name        = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  iam_user_access_to_billing = "ALLOW"
}

# Configure AWS Config
resource "aws_config_configuration_recorder" "config_recorder" {
  name = "my-config-recorder"
  role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::${aws_account.dev_account.id}:role/service-role/AWSConfigRole"
}

resource "aws_config_delivery_channel" "config_delivery_channel" {
  name          = "my-config-channel"
  s3_bucket_name = "my-config-bucket"
  sns_topic_arn = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-config-topic"
}

# Configure CloudTrail
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "cloudtrail_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-cloudtrail-bucket"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "cloudtrail" {
  name                          = "my-cloudtrail"
  s3_bucket_name                = aws_s3_bucket.cloudtrail_bucket.id
  include_global_service_events = true
}

Run Terraform Commands:

Run the following commands in the same directory as the main.tf file:

sh
Copy code
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
This example covers a simplified scenario for creating an AWS Landing Zone, setting up two AWS accounts, and configuring AWS Config Rules and CloudTrail. In a real-world scenario, you would have more advanced configurations, including custom policies, security controls, networking, and more.

Keep in mind that the provided Terraform code is a starting point and may need to be adapted to your organization's requirements and practices. It's important to thoroughly review and understand the implications of each configuration before applying them to your AWS environment. Additionally, always refer to the official AWS documentation and best practices for guidance on setting up AWS Landing Zones and related services.
